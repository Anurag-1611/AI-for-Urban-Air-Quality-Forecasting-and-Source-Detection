Introduction


Air pollution is one of the most critical environmental challenges faced by rapidly growing urban regions. This project aims to address the issue by building an AI-powered system that can forecast air quality levels and identify key pollution sources using real-time environmental and meteorological data.

By combining machine learning models, data preprocessing, and feature analysis, the system provides timely insights to help city planners, environmental agencies, and citizens take preventive actions. The project focuses on making air quality prediction more accurate, transparent, and actionable—paving the way for smarter, healthier cities.

# AI-for-Urban-Air-Quality-Forecasting-and-Source-Detection
A machine learning–based system that predicts urban air quality levels and identifies major pollution sources using real-time environmental data. This project combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to help cities monitor air pollution trends, take preventive action, and improve public health outcomes.
